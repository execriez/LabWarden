Legacy code, zipped up for archive purposes.


## Description

LabWarden is a MacOS management tool for implementing custom policies.

A Labwarden policy consists of a policy script and an accompanying policy profile (mobileconfig file).

Put together when I was managing a fleet of Macs with no budget for management software and had option other than to write my own.

No longer in development.
