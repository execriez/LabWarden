INSTALLATION:

Download the LabWarden zip archive from <https://github.com/execriez/LabWarden>, then unzip the archive on a Mac workstation. Locate, then double-click the "LabWarden.pkg" installer package which can be found in the "SupportFiles" directory.

Alternatively, install by running the package from the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/execriez/LabWarden/master/SupportFiles/LabWarden.pkg

The installer will install the following files and directories:

/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.labwarden.Sys-LoginWindow.plist
/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.labwarden.Sys-LoginWindowPoll.plist
/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.labwarden.Usr-AppWarden.plist

/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.labwarden.Usr-ManagedPrefs.plist
/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.labwarden.Usr-Poll.plist

/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.labwarden.Sys-ADwarden.plist
/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.labwarden.Sys-Boot.plist
/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.labwarden.Sys-ConsoleUserWarden.plist

/usr/LabWarden/

You should note that LabWarden does not (by default) make use of Login and Logout hooks - so can be installed side-by-side with projects that do.

After installation, you should reboot.
