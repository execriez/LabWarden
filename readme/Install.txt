INSTALLATION:

Download the LoginHookWarden zip archive from <https://github.com/execriez/LabWarden>, then unzip the archive on a Mac workstation.

Ideally, to install - you should double-click the following installer package which can be found in the "SupportFiles" directory.

  LabWarden.pkg

If the installer package isn't available, you can run the command-line installer which can be found in the "util" directory:

  sudo Install

The installer will install the following files and directories:

  /Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.labwarden.appwarden.plist
  /Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.labwarden.Sys-LoginWindow.plist
  /Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.labwarden.Sys-LoginWindowPoll.plist
  /Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.labwarden.Usr-AtDesktop.plist
  /Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.labwarden.Usr-Poll.plist
  /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.labwarden.ADwarden.plist
  /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.labwarden.ConsoleUserWarden.plist
  /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.labwarden.NetworkStatusWarden.plist
  /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.labwarden.Sys-Boot.plist
  /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.labwarden.Sys-Poll.plist
  /usr/LabWarden/

You should note that by default, LabWarden does not make use of Login and Logout hooks - so can be installed side-by-side with projects that do.

After installation, you should reboot.
